# Project 03 — Embedding Similarity Mini Search Engine

## Goal
Build a tiny "search engine" over vectors using cosine similarity.

Connects to:
- dot product
- norm
- cosine similarity
- nearest neighbor ranking

This mimics how semantic search works with embeddings (also relevant to RAG).

## Success Criteria
- Given a query vector, rank items by cosine similarity.
- Print top-k results.

## Stretch Goals
- Add Euclidean distance and compare rankings.
- Normalize embeddings and show how dot product == cosine.
