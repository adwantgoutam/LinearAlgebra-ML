# Project 02 — PCA Compression & Reconstruction

## Goal
Use PCA to compress 2D data into 1D and reconstruct it, then measure reconstruction error.

Connects to:
- eigenvectors / eigenvalues
- basis change
- low-rank approximation intuition

## Success Criteria
- Fit PCA, transform to 1D, reconstruct, and plot original vs reconstructed.
- Print explained variance.

## Stretch Goals
- Compare PCA eigen method vs SVD method.
- Try different k and plot reconstruction error vs k.
